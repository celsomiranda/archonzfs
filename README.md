# archonzfs
Install Arch on ZFS.

Uses eoli3n archiso-zfs script to load zfs modules into ISO.

Then installs arch with root on zfs. It currently only uses a single single vdev and I don't have the desire yet to add more options.

For installation it creates a dataset structure of:

zroot/enc -- encrypted, root is encrypted
zroot/pt -- unencrypted, if you wish to have anything stored unencrypted

Uses UKI generated by mkinitcpio for booting with systemd-boot for easy sourcing of UKIs.

WIP:
Using Clevis to decrypt a secret on disk to unlock encrypted root dataset.
